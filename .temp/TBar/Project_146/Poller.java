/**
 * For making asynchronous assertions.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For typical use, create an anonymous subclass inline, and implement the {@link #poll()} method:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * new Poller( times(10), every(100, MILLISECONDS) ) {
 *     public void poll() {
 *         assertThat(someMethodCall(), is("Success"));
 *     }
 * };
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This assertion will be called a number of times (configurable by using the different constructors). The first poll is tried immediately, so if you specify 3 attempts with 1 second pause, the total
 * execution time will be about 2 seconds.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class catches any {@link AssertionError} thrown in the first <em>n-1</em> attempts. If any other kind of Exception is encountered, or an AssertionError is thrown at the last attempt then it
 * will be thrown immediately and your test will fail. All AssertionErrors except the last are swallowed.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * For debugging purposes you may call {@link #loudly()} in your poll method, and interim AssertionErrors will be logged to System.out rather than being simply ignored.
 * </p>
